## What is this?
Shell script for creating kvm ubuntu guest with virsh

## How to use?
Edit create.sh to set machine name, cpus, memory, disk, etc.
Run ```./create.sh```

## Post install
I recommend [enabling](https://github.com/ethanfaust/sysadmin-docs/blob/main/ubuntu-console.md) the serial console.
